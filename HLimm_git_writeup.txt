No errors to report; however, I did take the time to set up my CLI so that I
was able to open files using Sublime Text 3 rather than VS Code (on Windows).
Below is how I accomplished this:

	- under C:\Users\<username>, create a .bash_profile file
		-- this is best done from a text editor -> Save as vs. in File Explorer

	- paste the following into the .bash_profile:
		-- alias subl="/c/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/subl.exe -w"
			--- note the forward slashes are to escape the space; apostrophe (')
					within the string should also work (see below)
			--- also note the -w to make Git Bash wait for the file to close
					before resuming the CLI

	- that should be all that's necessary

	- confirm that .gitconfig contains the following code (this should happen
		during installation if you choose to use Sublime 3)
		-- [core]
				editor = "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/subl.exe' -w "

I'm not sure how popular Sublime is among students now, but I'm sure that
someone might find it helpful to add this in an appendix or as a side note. It
seems that other text editors like Atom are a bit more simply integrated just as
VS Code is.
